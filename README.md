## About Brett Davis

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* C# is my favorite language. 
* My favorite sport is racquetball - unfortunately the entire world decided to get bored of it around 2010 
* I like to travel - I've been to 13 countries so far

	
### What drives you nuts?
* I get frustrated when people interrupt each other. I prefer to let people talk until they run out of things to say, and I think this allows more unfiltered and insightful opinion some air to breathe.

### What are your quirks?
* I have a hard time multi-tasking and context switching.
* I actually enjoy working in a windowless basement office. Maybe I was a salamander in a previous life?
